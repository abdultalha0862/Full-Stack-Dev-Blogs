## **Introduction**

I recently watched a conversation between **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Eddie Jaoude** titled *“*[*Travel the World While Freelancing.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHGvLd0JWpQ&t=6s&pp=ygUidHJhdmVsIHRoZSB3b3JsZCB3aGlsZSBmcmVlbGFuZGluZw%3D%3D)*”*

  
It completely changed how I view freelancing and open source. I used to think of open source mainly as a way to learn and collaborate, but now I see it as a gateway to real-world opportunities and proof of work that clients can trust.

## **Key Learnings**

1. **Start freelancing through open source.**  
    It’s the best way to showcase your skills and demonstrate your ability to solve real problems, something clients value highly.
    
2. **Freelancing vs full-time jobs.**  
    Both have pros and cons. Freelancing offers flexibility, but sometimes you might have no clients, so having a backup option helps.
    
3. **Build in public.**  
    Sharing what you learn, create, or struggle with attracts visibility and builds trust in your work.
    
4. **Experiment with both paths.**  
    Try freelancing and full-time work to see which aligns best with your goals and lifestyle.
    

## **My Reflection**

As an **open-source contributor at Ghost**, I have seen firsthand how contributing to projects helps build credibility. Clients and companies see open-source work as real proof that you can deliver.

I realised that open source not only opens doors for **job opportunities** but also for **freelancing gigs**. By consistently contributing, I am not just learning, I am also building a track record of practical experience that speaks for itself.

## **Final Thoughts**

This conversation reminded me that success doesn’t come from choosing one path; it comes from exploring both. I plan to experiment with **freelancing** and **full-time roles** to find what fits me best.

A huge thanks to **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Eddie Jaoude** for sharing these valuable insights.
