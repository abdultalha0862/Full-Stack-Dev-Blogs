## **Introduction**

Recently, I watched a [conversation](https://youtu.be/NAWAY5awdM8?si=kA_8Jx5waULfPFko) between **Matt van Itallie** and **Kunal Kushwaha** about utilising open source for career advancement. Matt shared insights from his experience working at a company that builds code quality tools and actively contributes to open source.

At this stage of my journey, I am actively contributing to open source and trying to understand which tech paths suit me best. This video helped me see how open source can be used not just for learning, but also for skill growth, career exploration, and long term direction.

## **Key Learnings**

### **About Sema**

Sema is a company that builds tools to improve code quality and code releases. They work closely with open source projects, where anyone can read the code, copy it, and raise issues. Maintainers review contributions and guide contributors to keep the project healthy.

This shows how companies rely on open source not only to build products, but also to grow strong communities.

### **What Is Open Source**

Open source means software whose code is publicly available. Anyone can:

* view the code
    
* report issues
    
* suggest improvements
    
* contribute changes
    

This open model allows people across the world to build software together and learn from real systems.

### **How Contribution Helps**

Contributing to open source helps in many ways:

1. **Skilling up**  
    You improve your skills through real code reviews and practical feedback.
    
2. **Mentorship**  
    You learn from maintainers and experienced contributors who guide you.
    
3. **Resume building**  
    Your contributions act as proof of work and show what you can actually do.
    
4. **Networking**  
    You connect with people working in the same domain and build professional relationships.
    
5. **Self exploration**  
    You can test whether a tech stack or role suits you before committing to it.
    

This matters because learning through real work is far more effective than only studying theory.

### **Roadmap for Beginners**

A simple roadmap for beginners is:

* Pick one organisation
    
* Choose an active community
    
* observe communication for one week
    
* start with small issues
    
* move to bigger contributions slowly
    

This approach helps beginners avoid confusion and build confidence step by step.

### **How to Contribute and Reach Out to Companies**

Instead of asking directly for jobs:

* contribute consistently
    
* help solve real problems
    
* show learning through your work
    

When your contributions create value, companies notice naturally. Conversations start based on trust, not requests.

### **Five Rules of a Great Contributor**

Some important rules to follow are:

* Focus on a few things and do them well
    
* be consistent
    
* respect maintainers’ time
    
* communicate clearly
    
* be empathetic and helpful
    

These habits make collaboration smoother and build long-term trust.

### **Getting Hired**

Open source helps with hiring because:

* Your work is visible
    
* Your contributions show real skills
    
* Recruiters can see your growth over time
    

This matters because proof of work builds more trust than resumes alone.

### **Best Tech Stack to Contribute**

There is no single best tech stack. The right stack is one that:

* genuinely interests you
    
* has active maintainers
    
* offers beginner-friendly issues
    

Enjoyment and consistency matter more than choosing a popular stack.

### **Learn in Public**

Learning in public means:

* asking questions openly
    
* sharing progress
    
* discussing challenges
    

This helps others learn and slowly builds your credibility through consistency.

### **Which Contributions Look Good**

Good contributions are:

* consistent
    
* useful to the project
    
* well documented
    
* respectful in communication
    

Quality matters more than the number of contributions.

## **My Reflection**

My biggest learning from this video is:

* **Safe exploration**  
    Open source allows me to explore whether a particular tech stack or role suits me without long-term commitment.
    
* **Choosing the right organisation**  
    Selecting an active and supportive organisation matters for learning and growth.
    
* **Good contribution practices**  
    Following contribution guidelines and asking questions in public channels helps build trust and visibility.
    

## **Behind the Scenes**

While watching this video, I wrote all my notes in my **physical notebook**. Writing by hand helps me slow down and think clearly. Later, I convert those raw notes into a structured blog.

This process helps me:

* understand ideas deeply
    
* reflect on what I learn
    
* track my progress over time
    

This is a core part of my Learn in Public journey.

(This is where I add images of my handwritten notes.)

## **Final Thoughts**

Open source is not just about writing code. It helps with learning, networking, career exploration, and building trust.

This conversation reminded me that consistent and thoughtful contributions can quietly shape a strong career over time.
