## **Introduction**

I recently watched a [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktuTK08cigs&t=278s) between **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Andy Jeffries**, the CTO of Civo. The discussion focused on an important question many people struggle with:

**Does having a degree really determine your success in tech?**

As someone who didn’t come from a traditional tech background, this topic felt very relevant. The conversation gave me a clearer understanding of how the tech industry looks at skills, education, and real-world ability.

## **Key Learnings**

### **1\. Degree vs Bootcamp—Both Have Value**

Andy explained that both degrees and bootcamps play different roles:

* **Bootcamps** help people coming from non-tech backgrounds learn programming fundamentals quickly.
    
* **Degrees** provide a deeper understanding of computer science concepts, which can be helpful in certain roles.
    

But the main point was:

> **A degree is useful, but your skills and real work matter more.**

### **2\. What Actually Matters in Tech**

Companies care less about your background and more about:

* What you can build
    
* How do you solve problems
    
* How you communicate
    
* Your GitHub activity and open-source involvement
    

If you can do the job well, your degree (or lack of it) becomes much less important.

### **3\. What Companies Look for in Candidates**

Andy shared the qualities he looks for when hiring:

* **Self-motivation**
    
* **Ability to figure things out when stuck**
    
* **Clear and honest communication**
    
* **How do you discuss issues and solutions publicly**
    

These qualities show how you think and how you work—both are more important than your degree.

### **4\. What You Should Look for in a Company**

A good company should offer:

* **Growth opportunities**
    
* **Impactful work**
    
* **International exposure**
    

Where you choose to work can shape your learning and career direction.

## **My Reflection**

This conversation made me reflect on my own journey.

I understood that:

* If you don’t have a degree, your **work must speak for you**.
    
* A strong **project portfolio** or **open-source profile** creates more value than a certificate.
    
* Tech changes quickly, so staying **curious, consistent, and self-driven** is essential.
    
* The most important thing is your **ability to learn and solve problems**, not your educational background.
    

This gives hope to anyone entering tech from a different field.

## **Final Thoughts**

A degree can help. A boot camp can help. But neither *defines* your future. Your skills, consistency, and problem-solving ability matter far more.

This conversation reminded me that tech is one of the few fields where **your work speaks louder than your background**. If you stay focused and keep improving, you can build a successful career, no matter where you started.
