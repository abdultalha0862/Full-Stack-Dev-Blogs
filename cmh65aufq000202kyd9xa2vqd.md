## **Introduction**  

I recently watched a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUR5f_1bFaE) video by Brian Schuster and Kunal Kushwaha from IBM discussing their tech journey. He demonstrated how he viewed change as an opportunity for learning and growth. His experience teaches us that it’s never too late to start over if you have curiosity and the right mindset.

## **Key Learnings**  

1\. **Brian’s Journey**  

Brian explained how he transitioned into tech after attending a boot camp. He learned Python and used his family business experience for roles like Business Analyst and Data Analyst. He eventually became a Cloud Engineer (DevOps) at IBM and began mentoring others who wanted to make similar transitions.

2\. **How to Know if Tech Is for You**  

The best way to find out is to try it. If you don’t enjoy it, it's okay to switch to another field. Work on hands-on projects, contribute to open-source, or attend hackathons. If it excites you, keep going. If not, you’ll still gain valuable skills.

3\. **How to Get Your First Role in Tech**  

Stay open-minded and eager to learn. You don’t need to know everything at the start. Growth comes from real work experience. Be patient.

4\. **How to Decide if It's Time to Move On**  

If you stop growing or if the company culture doesn’t match your values, consider exploring new opportunities. Your career should help you grow, both professionally and personally.

5\. **How to Change Careers if You're Already Experienced**  

If you have experience in another field, show your skills through evidence:  

1. Write blogs  
    
2. Build projects  
    
3. Contribute to open-source communities  
    

These examples say more than your past job titles.

6\. **How to Approach the Job Market**  

Focus on one field and create a strong portfolio that includes:  

1. Blogs about what you learn  
    
2. Projects you’ve built  
    
3. LinkedIn posts showing your progress  
    

Don’t hesitate to ask for referrals. The tech community is often supportive.

## **My Reflection**  

From this talk, I learned it’s never too late to switch if your current path isn’t right for you. Change doesn’t mean failure; it means growth. I also recognised the importance of asking for referrals, building connections, and sharing your progress. The key is to keep learning, experimenting, and adapting.

## **Final Thoughts**  

Brian’s story shows that transitioning into tech isn’t just about learning tools or coding languages. It’s about resilience, curiosity, and ongoing learning. No matter where you start, your journey is valid as long as you keep moving forward. Thanks to Brian Schuster for sharing his insights. This talk reminded me that tech welcomes everyone willing to learn.
