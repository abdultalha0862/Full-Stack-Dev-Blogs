## Introduction

Recently, I watched a talk between [**Kunal Kushwaha**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-kushwaha/?originalSubdomain=uk) and **Kai Hoffman** about *Cloud Native Developer Advocacy*. I expected another tech discussion, but it opened my eyes to a new role: **Developer Advocacy**. This role combines communication, empathy, and technology uniquely.

I learned that some people in tech do more than write code; they connect it to the world. They simplify complex ideas so everyone can understand them, keeping the tech community thriving.

## Key Learnings

Here’s what I learned from their conversation:

1. **Bridging the Gap**: Developer Advocacy connects developers with client needs, making sure both sides understand each other.
    
2. **For Those Who Love Coding and Communicating**: If you enjoy solving problems and sharing your knowledge, this role may be for you.
    
3. **Experiment Before You Decide**: Try out different roles before committing. See what fits your strengths and interests.
    
4. **Maintain Balance**: Advocacy often involves travel and events. Finding a work-life balance is important for your well-being and creativity.
    

These ideas might seem simple, but they are valuable for anyone looking to grow in tech.

## My Reflection

This talk showed me how diverse and human-focused tech can be. It’s not only about writing code; it involves understanding people, listening to their challenges, and sharing knowledge to help others grow.

I see Developer Advocacy not just as a job, but as a mindset. It’s about learning openly, communicating clearly, and helping others feel included in technology. Communication can help break down technical barriers. Developers often focus on logic and syntax, but the real magic happens when you explain the importance of your code and how it solves real problems. That’s where advocacy truly excels.

## Final Thoughts

One idea stuck with me after watching this video: tech involves more than just development. Some roles include curiosity, empathy, and storytelling to make technology more accessible. Developer Advocacy is one of them.

Thanks to **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Kai Hoffman** for inspiring this realisation. Their talk reminded me that in tech, your ability to connect and communicate is as important as your coding skills.

This post is part of my *Learn in Public* series, where I share what I discover in my journey through open source and software development.

Are there other lesser-known roles in tech that have surprised or inspired you? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments!
