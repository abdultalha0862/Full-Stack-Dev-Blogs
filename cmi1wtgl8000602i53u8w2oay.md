## **Introduction**

Recently, I watched a [conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2V1xXCl8pw) between **Kunal Kushwaha and Alex** about DevOps, open source, and how people land remote jobs through their contributions. I documented everything in my physical notebook first and later converted it into this blog. This discussion gave me clarity on the role of open source, communities, learning styles, and the structure behind real-world contributions.

## **Key Learnings**

### **1\. How Open Source Helps**

Open source isn’t just about sending pull requests; it’s a way to **showcase real proof of work**.  
By maintaining repositories, writing clear READMEs, and contributing consistently, anyone (including a hiring manager) can see:

* your thought process
    
* the quality of your work
    
* The impact of your contributions
    

Open source becomes a living portfolio. Instead of telling people what you know, you **show** them.

### **2\. How to Learn Anything New**

Everyone has their own learning style, videos, blogs, docs, building, or hands-on experimenting.  
The important part is:

* **start small**
    
* try things on your own
    
* document what you learn
    
* avoid getting stuck in endless tutorials
    

Hands-on practice + project-based learning always works better than passively consuming content.

### **3\. Downsides of Open Source**

Open source is powerful, but it also has challenges:

* Maintainers receive huge numbers of PRs and must push hard to review them.
    
* There is a **strict structure** behind contributing, reviewing, and merging code.
    
* Beginners often underestimate the workflow and feel discouraged when PRs are rejected.
    

But these challenges are part of the learning curve, and they teach how real engineering teams work.

## **My Reflection**

This video reminded me of the importance of communities. As a full-stack developer, I realised I need to **find and actively engage with communities** related to my field. Participation brings clarity—once you show up, you slowly understand how things work.

I also learned the value of maintaining a proper README or learning file. When I document my learning clearly, it shows my thinking, progress, and structure something that matters to both open-source maintainers and recruiters.

## **Behind the Scenes: My Raw Notes**

Before writing this blog, I captured everything in my physical notebook while watching the video.  
Converting raw handwritten thoughts into structured content helps me:

* remember concepts better
    
* reflect deeply
    
* write with clarity
    
* avoid losing ideas
    

This “raw first, polish later” process makes my learning more intentional and helps me stay consistent.

## **Final Thoughts**

This conversation helped me understand that open source is not only about contributing code, but it is also a pathway to remote work, community building, structured learning, and showcasing your real abilities.

It taught me to stay consistent, document my growth, and be active in communities that align with my goals. The journey is long, but with the right process, it becomes meaningful.
