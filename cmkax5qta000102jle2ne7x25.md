## Introduction

This post shares my notes and reflections after watching a conversation on getting remote jobs through open source and learning in public.

I am writing this as someone who is still learning and exploring these ideas, not as an expert.

If you’re early in your career and curious about remote opportunities and open source, this might be useful.

## Why I Watched This Conversation

I wanted to understand how people actually find remote jobs through open source and how learning in public fits into that journey.

I had heard these ideas before, but this conversation helped connect them more clearly through real experiences.

## What the Conversation Focused On

The discussion covered open source contributions, consistency, building projects in public, technical writing, and how these efforts can gradually lead to remote opportunities.

## Key Learnings from the Conversation

### It’s Never Too Late to Start Open Source

A key point was that timing and age do not matter in open source.

What matters is starting and staying consistent.

**Why this matters:**  
Waiting for the “right time” often delays growth more than lack of skills.

### Consistency Matters More Than Speed

Regular contributions help people notice your work over time.

This naturally helps in building a network and trust.

**Why this matters:**  
Most meaningful opportunities come from consistent effort, not quick results.

### Open Source Projects Act as Proof of Work

Building projects in public and keeping them open makes your work visible.

You don’t need to explain everything repeatedly your work speaks for itself.

**Why this matters:**

Open work becomes real proof of learning and capability.

### Learning in Public Through Technical Writing

Technical writing was discussed as a simple way to learn in public.

Platforms like Hashnode allow you to convert raw notes into clear articles, which can sometimes reach wider developer communities.

**Why this matters:**

Writing helps you learn better while sharing value with others.

### Focus on Sharing, Not Immediate Outcomes

A strong message was to avoid focusing on what you’ll get in return.

Instead, focus on contributing, learning, and sharing honestly.

**Why this matters:**  
When contribution is the goal, outcomes often follow naturally.

## Things That Made Me Think

* Age and timing matter less than consistency
    
* Open source quietly builds strong networks
    
* Writing is a powerful learning tool
    
* Growth doesn’t need to be fast or loud
    

## My Reflections

This conversation reinforced the importance of sharing what I’m learning and learning from others’ experiences.

It reminded me that steady contribution and openness matter more than chasing quick results.

## What I’m Taking Forward

* Start and stay consistent with open source
    
* Share learning without pressure
    
* Focus on community and clarity
    
* Use writing as a thinking tool
