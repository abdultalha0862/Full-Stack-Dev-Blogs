## Introduction

I encountered SQLite errors while setting up Ghost CMS on Windows. After some troubleshooting, I found a successful solution using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Here’s how I resolved the issue.

## Identifying the Problem

I followed Ghost's installation guide thoroughly:  
  
1\. Installed the LTS version of Node.js  
2\. Confirmed npm/yarn functionality  
3\. Set up Python and required build tools  
4\. Double-checked all prerequisites  
  
Despite these steps, the command `ghost install local` failed, returning confusing SQLite error messages not covered in the documentation.

## The Solution: Utilising WSL

Many Windows users experience complications with Node.js and SQLite. The most effective solution is to switch to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Steps to Fix SQLite Errors in Ghost Installation:

1. **Verify Prerequisites in WSL**
    
    ```bash
    node --version  
    npm --version  
    python3 --version
    ```
    
2. **Install Ghost CLI**
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g ghost-cli@latest
    ```
    
3. **Execute Local Installation**
    
    ```bash
    ghost install local
    ```
    
4. **Confirm Setup**
    
    ```bash
    ghost start  
    ghost stop
    ```
    

Running these commands in WSL resolved all SQLite errors.

## Why WSL is Effective

WSL provides a Linux environment that avoids common issues faced in Windows setups. Ghost's dependencies function without complications in this setting.

## Key Takeaways for Developers

* Prioritise compatibility over code quality.
    
* When facing persistent issues, consider changing your environment instead of spending excessive time debugging.
    
* WSL is crucial for Node.js development on Windows.
    
* Document your solutions to assist fellow developers.
    

## What’s Next?

With Ghost successfully running locally, I’m diving into the codebase to contribute to the project. My aim is to establish credibility in open source and support a platform that facilitates many developer blogs.
