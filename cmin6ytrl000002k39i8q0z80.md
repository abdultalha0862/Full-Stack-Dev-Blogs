## **Introduction**

Recently, I watched a conversation between **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Sanskar Jethi** about his journey from open source contributions to securing an off-campus role at **Bloomberg London**. The discussion was simple, honest, and packed with practical insights for developers like me who are growing through open source.

## **Key Learnings**

### **1\. Open Source Is Collaboration, Not Competition**

Sanskar emphasised that open source is about working *together*.  
There is no scoreboard, no race, and no rivalry.  
It’s a collaborative space where developers from different backgrounds unite to solve problems and build something meaningful for the community.

### **2\. Impact Comes From Projects Used by Real People**

The value of your work increases when it reaches real users.  
Sanskar highlighted the importance of contributing to projects that people rely on globally.  
Such projects not only sharpen your skills but also give you visible proof of real-world impact.

## **My Reflection**

This conversation helped me understand that open source is more than just code—it’s a mindset.  
Focusing on collaboration, community, and meaningful contributions matters far more than competing for visibility.  
This shift in perspective motivates me to contribute consistently and work on projects that help real users.

## **Final Thoughts**

Thanks to **Kunal** and **Sanskar** for sharing such actionable insights. Their conversation is a reminder that open source can open doors—not just to jobs, but to growth, learning, and impact.
