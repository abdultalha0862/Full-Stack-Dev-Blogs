## Introduction

I watched this conversation to understand how resumes actually work in the tech industry. I wasn’t looking for templates or formatting tricks. I wanted clarity on how resumes signal value, especially for someone early in their career.

Instead of focusing on design or keywords, the discussion centred on **thinking systems,** how to observe your work, document it, and translate it into evidence. That perspective made me revisit how I was building my own resume.

## Key Learnings

### 1\. Accomplishments matter more than responsibilities

A resume should highlight outcomes, not task lists. Instead of describing what I did, I should show what changed because of my work and what I learned from it.

### 2\. Comparative analysis helps identify the right work

By listing every meaningful experience and separating what I liked from what I didn’t, patterns emerge. These patterns reveal the intersection between my personality and the type of work I should pursue in the future.

### 3\. Maintaining an accomplishment journal is essential

An accomplishment journal helps track:

* Moments of success
    
* Situations where I worked hard
    
* New skills I learned
    
* Instances where I helped or taught others
    

This makes resume writing concrete instead of relying on memory.

### 4\. Accomplishment journals improve interview readiness

By documenting experiences clearly, I can frame them as stories during interviews. Specific stories are easier to remember and explain than vague claims.

### 5\. Feedback is evidence, not validation

Recording compliments or positive feedback from teachers, peers, or managers helps identify strengths objectively. These entries act as external proof of impact.

### 6\. The logical model clarifies resume bullet points

Each experience can be structured using:

* Resources available
    
* Activities performed
    
* Outputs produced
    
* Outcomes achieved
    

This approach forces clarity and removes ambiguity from resume content.

### 7\. Resume structure should prioritise clarity over design

For early-career professionals:

* Keep the resume to one page
    
* Avoid visuals, colours, or decorative elements
    
* Use margins between 0.5 and 1 inch
    
* Fill about 80–85% of the page to allow breathing space
    

Structure and content matter more than appearance.

### 8\. Removing the summary section improves focus

Early in a career, summaries often repeat claims without evidence. Removing them creates space for concrete accomplishments instead.

### 9\. The 50-hour rule defines what belongs on a resume

Any meaningful work done for at least 50 hours (sometimes even 25) is worth mentioning. This includes projects, features built, code reviews, and quality improvements.

### 10\. Reflection matters more than frequent updates

The hardest part of resume building is not writing, it’s remembering. Spending one hour each week reflecting and updating an accomplishment journal solves this problem.

### 11\. Numbers turn effort into evidence

Adding numbers wherever possible transforms normal statements into measurable impact. Numbers make contributions easier to understand and evaluate.

## My Reflection

* This video gave me a new perspective on building a resume beyond formatting and templates.
    
* I understood the importance of maintaining an accomplishment journal to document meaningful work consistently.
    
* I learned how to structure a resume with a clear focus on layout, visuals, and content, without depending on design elements.
    

## **Behind the Scenes**

While watching this video, I wrote all my notes in my **physical notebook**. Writing by hand helps me slow down and think clearly. Later, I convert those raw notes into a structured blog.

This process helps me:

* understand ideas deeply
    
* reflect on what I learn
    
* track my progress over time
    

This is a core part of my Learn in Public journey.

## Final Thoughts

This conversation opened a different way to think about resumes, rooted in observation, evidence, and clarity. Instead of chasing perfection in formatting, I learned to focus on documenting meaningful work consistently.

For me, resume building is no longer a one-time task. It’s a habit.
