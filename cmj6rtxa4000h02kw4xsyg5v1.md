## **Introduction**

Recently, I watched a [conversation](https://youtu.be/02J8HBInsJU?si=wSBeyWX6TFvEwmnr) between **Kunal Kushwaha** and **Matt van Itallie** about learning in public for career growth.

This discussion helped me understand what learning in public really means and why it is important in today’s tech careers.

Earlier, I thought learning was something we should do quietly. This video showed me that sharing learning openly can help not only individuals but also entire communities.

## **Key Learnings**

1. ### **Learning in Public Means Sharing Progress**
    

Learning in public means sharing your questions, progress, and learnings openly.  
It is not about showing expertise. It is about showing how you are learning step by step.

2. ### **Public Questions Help More People**
    

When you ask a question publicly, many people benefit from it.  
Others who have the same question can learn from the answers and discussions.

3. ### **Psychological Safety Is Important**
    

In remote teams and online communities, people should feel safe to ask questions and admit mistakes.  
There should be no fear of embarrassment.

If a community is rude to beginners, it is better to leave.  
If a community supports beginners, it is a good place to learn and grow.

4. ### **Giving Feedback the Right Way**
    

Feedback should be clear, calm, and useful.  
Instead of saying “Good job,” it is better to explain what was done well and why.

The same applies to negative feedback. It should clearly explain the issue and how to improve.

5. ### **Observe Before Giving Feedback**
    

When joining a new community or team, it is good to observe first.  
Watch how seniors and leaders communicate before sharing your own feedback.

6. ### **Choosing the Right Community**
    

Very large communities can feel confusing.  
Very small communities may not be active.

Medium-sized communities that welcome new members are often the best places to learn.

7. ### **Imposter Syndrome Is Normal**
    

Many people feel imposter syndrome when they start.  
No one begins as an expert. Skills and confidence grow with time and practice.

8. ### **Career Benefits of Learning in Public**
    

Learning in public helps build proof of work over time.  
Your questions, posts, and contributions show your growth and help build credibility.

## **My Reflection**

My biggest takeaway from this video is that **learning in public builds credibility over time, not by being perfect, but by being consistent**.

You do not need to know everything before you start sharing.  
Showing up regularly and learning openly matter more than trying to look perfect.

## **Behind the Scenes**

While watching this video, I wrote all my notes in my **physical notebook**, as I usually do.  
Later, I converted those raw notes into this blog.

This process helps me:

* think clearly
    
* remember concepts better
    
* reflect on what I learned
    
* track my progress over time
    

This is an important part of my Learn in Public journey.

## **Final Thoughts**

Learning in public is not about showing off.  
It is about learning, sharing, and growing together with the community.

This conversation reminded me that careers grow faster when we learn openly and support each other.
