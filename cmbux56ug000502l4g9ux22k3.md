## Intro to Express JS

Express is a simple and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It offers many features to help you build web and mobile applications. Express sits on top of Node.js, making it easier to develop server-side applications and manage HTTP requests and responses.

## Requests, Responses and Routes

**Request** (req): Contains the incoming HTTP request details including URL path, query parameters, body, and headers to understand client data.

**Response** (res): Creates and sends HTTP responses using methods like send(), json(), status(), and redirect() to set response properties.

**Route**: Links an HTTP method with a URL pattern, triggering handler functions when requests match the defined pattern.

## Middlewares

Middleware in Express.js are functions that handle incoming HTTP requests and outgoing responses. They act as helpers in the request-response process of the application. These functions can access the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the sequence (next).

## ejs Template Engines

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a tool used with Express.js to create dynamic HTML pages using JavaScript. It lets you include JavaScript code in HTML templates using special tags. EJS helps keep your display (HTML) separate from your application logic. You can pass data from the server to the template, which is helpful for showing dynamic content like user profiles, lists, or forms.

# Challenges and Solutions

1. Challenge: I faced a challenge understanding the concept of middleware.
    
    Solution: After exploring the middleware concept on [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js/express-js/), I gained full clarity on the topic.
