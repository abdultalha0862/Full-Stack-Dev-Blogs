## Introduction

I recently watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HVwKVxdPxo) of Kunal Kushwaha talking with Magali Malkin, a recruiter from Google. This conversation changed how I view the interview and hiring process.

Before this, I thought getting shortlisted for a job depended only on having a great resume or on sharing success stories during interviews. However, I learned that many factors matter, from resume formatting and timing of applications to communication during the hiring process and handling interview failures.

## Key Learnings

### 1\. How Resumes Get Shortlisted

* The resume must be well-formatted and include the skills listed in the job description.
    
* Apply early to increase your chances of being noticed.
    
* Avoid using too many infographics. Choose a simple format that highlights your relevant skills, making it easier for recruiters to focus on what’s important.
    

### 2\. What Happens After the Resume Is Shortlisted

* Once a resume is shortlisted, a long process usually follows. This typically includes a DSA round, a technical round, and an HR round.
    
* Keep in touch with the recruiter and show genuine interest in the role. This reflects professionalism and enthusiasm.
    

### 3\. How to Frame Answers: The STAR Format

* Use the STAR format to structure your interview answers:
    
    * **S (Situation)**: Clearly explain the situation.
        
    * **T (Task)**: Describe the task or challenge you had.
        
    * **A (Action)**: Explain the action you took.
        
    * **R (Result)**: Share the result.
        
* It's okay if the result is not positive. What matters is explaining what you learned from the experience.
    

### 4\. Importance of Referrals and Networking

* Networking is powerful. Building relationships in the industry can help you get referrals.
    
* Referred candidates often receive more attention, and their process tends to be quicker. Connect with professionals, build genuine relationships, and don’t hesitate to ask for referrals.
    

### 5\. Setting Priorities Instead of Aiming for One Company

* Don’t focus on just one company. Instead, determine what matters most to you in a workplace, such as culture, learning opportunities, or job type.
    
* This focus helps you find the right fit instead of just chasing a big name.
    
* Remember, fear of failure and rejection are part of the process. Each rejection teaches you something new and helps you grow.
    

## My Reflection

I realised I had some misconceptions about interviews. I thought I should only share success stories, but now I know it’s okay to discuss failures as long as I explain what I learned. I also used to have a dream company in mind, but now I want to focus on what I want from a company and find one that aligns with my goals.

## Final Thoughts

The conversation between Kunal Kushwaha and Magali Malkin taught me more than just interview tips. It helped me see the process differently. A good resume doesn’t need to be fancy; it should be clear and relevant. Interview answers don’t always need a positive ending; honesty and learning are more important. Networking is about creating real connections, not just asking for favours. And remember, rejections aren’t failures; they’re lessons that prepare you for the next opportunity.

I will apply these lessons as I move forward, staying genuine, curious, and open to learning from every experience.

If this story resonates with you, share it with others preparing for interviews. A good conversation can change how we view our career journey.
