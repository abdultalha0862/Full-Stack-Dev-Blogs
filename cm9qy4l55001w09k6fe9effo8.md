# Introduction

## Git

1. Git is a version control system that allows users to collaborate. The version control system tracks all changes in files.
    
2. It is used to manage the history of the code.
    
3. It is free, open-source software.
    

## GitHub

1. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. Other names for repositories are directory, folder, or repository.
    
2. It allows for the storage and sharing of code with others.
    

# Setup

## Step 1: Install Git

Git can be installed using the link below:

[https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step 2: Create an Account on GitHub

We can create an account with Google. If you have a student account, you'll get additional benefits in the form of a Student Developer Pack.

## Step 3: Configure Git with GitHub

```bash
git config --global user.email 'youremail@gmail.com'
git config --global user.name 'yourname'
git config --list
```

1. The above commands are used to configure Git. Replace “[youremail@gmail.com](mailto:youremail@gmail.com)” with your email.
    
2. In the username section “yourname,” enter your username.
    
3. The last command will display the configuration details, including your email and other settings.
    

# Git Terminologies

When we install Git, we get a terminal called Git Bash. Using Git Bash, we can execute commands in Git.

### 1\. Creating a Folder

First, create a folder, then perform operations. A folder can also be created using the `mkdir` command in Git Bash:

```bash
mkdir folder_name
```

### 2\. Initialization of a Repository

In this step, we initialize the repository using the command below. This step is essential, as skipping it will result in a fatal error:

```bash
git init
```

### 3\. Git Flow

Git flow starts with the initialization of a repository. Then, files are added to the staging area, committed to the repository, and finally pushed to GitHub.

### 4\. Status

Check the status of files to see which are added, which need to be committed, and which need to be pushed to GitHub:

```bash
git status
```

### 5\. Adding Files

Files, whether text files or programming files, can be added using the command below:

```bash
git add filename.extension
```

To add all files in a folder:

```bash
git add .
```

### 6\. Commit Files

After adding files, they move to the staging area. Then, files are committed to create a snapshot of the staged changes:

```bash
git commit -m "message"
```

Replace “message” with a description of the commit.

### 7\. Log

View the history of changes in the repository:

```bash
git log
```

To display the log in a single-line format:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

### 8\. Creating a New Branch

List all branches in the repository:

```bash
git branch
```

Create a new branch:

```bash
git branch branch_name
```

### 9\. Switching Between Branches

Switch to a specific branch:

```bash
git switch branch_name
```

Create and switch to a new branch in a single command:

```bash
git switch -c branch_name
```

Alternatively, use the older `checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout branch_name
```

### 10\. Merging Two Branches

To merge two branches, switch to the main branch and run the command below with the name of the branch you want to merge:

```bash
git merge branch_name
```

### 11\. Renaming and Deleting Branches

Rename a branch:

```bash
git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name
```

Delete a branch:

```bash
git branch -d branch_name
```

### 12\. Diff

Show differences between two commits or branches:

```bash
git diff branch_name_1 branch_name_2
```

Compare specific commits using their hash IDs (retrieved via `git log`):

```bash
git diff commit_hash_1 commit_hash_2
```

### 13\. Stash

Save changes temporarily using:

```bash
git stash
```

Name the saved changes:

```bash
git stash save "Saved file"
```

View the list of stashed changes:

```bash
git stash list
```

### 14\. Moving Code to GitHub

Before pushing code to GitHub, configure Git and GitHub. Create a repository in GitHub, copy its URL, and run the following commands:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add origin 'https://github.com/username/repository_name.git'
git push origin main
```

Replace `'`[`https://github.com/username/repository_name.git`](https://github.com/username/repository_name.git)`'` with your repository's URL.

# Challenges, Solutions, and Resources

**Challenge 1: Initial Configuration Issues**

* **Problem**: Errors during `git config` due to incorrect email or username formatting.
    
* **Solution**: Carefully follow the syntax and use `git config --list` it to verify configurations.
    
* **Resource Used**: Git documentation ([link](https://git-scm.com/doc)).
    

**Challenge 2: Repository Initialization Errors**

* **Problem**: Fatal errors during `git init`.
    
* **Solution**: Ensure you're in the correct directory before running the command.
    
* **Resources Used**: Tutorials on Git basics, such as Atlassian Git Tutorials.
    

**Challenge 3: Managing Code History and Logs**

* **Problem**: Logs are too verbose and hard to read.
    
* **Solution**: Use `git log --oneline` for a simplified view.
