## CRUD Operations

CRUD in MongoDB refers to the four fundamental Operations Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic actions to manage data.

* Create and add new documents.
    
* Read retrieves data.
    
* Update changes on existing documents.
    
* Delete removes documents.
    

These actions help store, access, and manage data in MongoDB collections efficiently.

```jsx
use("crudDB")
db.createCollection("Details")
db.Details.insertOne({
    "name":"Sanjai",
    "Age":19
})

db.Details.insertMany([
    {
        "name": "Sanjai",
        "Age": 19
    },
    {
        "name": "Anjali",
        "Age": 21
    },
    {
        "name": "Rahul",
        "Age": 22
    },
    {
        "name": "Meena",
        "Age": 20
    },
    {
        "name": "Arjun",
        "Age": 23
    }
]
)

db.Details.find({Age:23})

db.Details.updateOne({Age:23},{$set:{Age:20}})

db.Details.deleteMany({Age:19})
```

## Operators in MongoDB

In MongoDB, operators are symbols or keywords used to handle data. Here are some common types:

* Comparison operators, such as $eq, $gt, and $lt, are used to compare values.
    
* Logical operators, like $and, $or, and $not, help combine multiple conditions.
    
* Update operators, including $set, $inc, and $unset, modify fields in documents.
    

# TailwindCSS

Tailwind CSS is a framework that helps you build websites easily. It offers a set of ready-to-use utility classes. These classes let you create custom designs without needing to write your own CSS. This approach promotes consistency, scalability, and efficiency.

# Challenges and Solutions

Problem: I had trouble installing Tailwind CSS because the styles were not applying correctly.

Solution: To resolve this issue, I completely uninstalled Tailwind CSS. Then, I reinstalled it by carefully following the official steps. This solved the issue, and the styles worked as they should.
