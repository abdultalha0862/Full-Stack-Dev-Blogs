## Introduction

When you think about open source, you might imagine developers fixing huge bugs, adding features, or diving into complex backend systems.

But my first contribution to **Ghost**, an open-source publishing platform, was not about any of that.

It was about a *spinner,* a tiny loading indicator that almost no one noticed... because it was **invisible**.

That small bug became my gateway into open source, teaching me about debugging, design systems, accessibility, and collaboration.

## How It Started

While exploring Ghost‚Äôs GitHub issues, I came across [Issue #24706](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/24706):

> ‚ÄúSpinner color contrast issue in Share Profile.‚Äù

It did not sound glamorous, just a UI detail, but something about it caught my attention.  
If users cannot see feedback while an action is happening, the experience feels broken.

So I decided, *this is the issue I‚Äôll fix.*

## Setting Up My Environment

Before touching any code, I had to set up Ghost locally, a challenge in itself.

It involved:

* Forking and cloning the repo
    
* Installing dependencies using `yarn install`
    
* Setting up **MySQL**, **Redis**, and **Caddy** (for ActivityPub)
    
* Enabling **ActivityPub** in Ghost‚Äôs configuration
    

It took patience, multiple retries, and a lot of reading through Ghost‚Äôs contributor docs. But once I saw Ghost running locally, I knew I was ready.

## Reproducing the Bug

Inside Ghost‚Äôs admin panel, under:  
**Network ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Share your profile**,  
Users can generate shareable profile images with three backgrounds:

* Light mode
    
* Dark mode
    
* Accent colour mode
    

When I clicked **‚ÄúCopy Image‚Äù**, I noticed the issue immediately:  
The **spinner** appeared... but it was **barely visible,** sometimes completely invisible.

| Mode | Button Background | Spinner Color | Visibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Light | Black | Black | ‚ùå Barely visible |
| Dark | White | White | ‚ùå Invisible |
| Accent | Black | Black | ‚ùå Barely visible |

A tiny problem, but one that breaks the feedback loop for users.

## Tracing the Root Cause

The issue came from a simple logic flaw in `Profile.tsx`:

```typescript
<LoadingIndicator 
    color={`${backgroundColor === 'dark' ? 'dark' : 'light'}`} 
    size='sm' 
/>
```

It based the spinner colour on the *page background,* not the *button* it was sitting on.

Result: perfect logic, wrong context.

## The Fix

I wrote a small helper function that picked the spinner colour based on the actual button colour:

```typescript
const getSpinnerColorForButton = (backgroundColor: 'light' | 'dark' | 'accent') => {
    switch (backgroundColor) {
        case 'light': return 'light'; // White spinner on dark button
        case 'dark': return 'dark';  // Black spinner on white button
        case 'accent': return 'light'; // White spinner on dark button
        default: return 'dark';
    }
};
```

Then replaced the inline ternary with:

```typescript
<LoadingIndicator color={getSpinnerColorForButton(backgroundColor)} size='sm' />
```

A two-line change, but now, the spinner adapted perfectly in all modes.

## Testing the Solution

After rebuilding Ghost locally, I tested all three modes again.

| Mode | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | White spinner | ‚úÖ Visible |
| Dark | Black spinner | ‚úÖ Visible |
| Accent | White spinner | ‚úÖ Visible |

Success üéâ

What once was an invisible spinner now gave clear feedback across every theme.

## Submitting My Pull Request

Following Ghost‚Äôs commit guidelines, I wrote this commit message:

```bash
Fixed spinner visibility in Share Profile copy button

closes https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/24706

Added getSpinnerColorForButton() helper function to ensure optimal contrast 
between spinner and button backgrounds, improving UX in ActivityPub Share Profile.
```

Created a branch, pushed changes, and submitted my **first ever PR** to an open-source project.

## Why This Small Fix Mattered

This was not just a cosmetic change.  
It improved accessibility, user trust, and consistency subtly, but meaningfully.

It taught me that:

1. Even the smallest UI bug affects user confidence.
    
2. Simplicity is powerful when done with intention.
    
3. Contributing isn‚Äôt about complexity, it‚Äôs about *care*.
    

## Lessons I Learned

* **Observe before coding** ‚Äî clarity saves hours.
    
* **Context matters** ‚Äî a ‚Äúdark‚Äù mode doesn‚Äôt mean everything is dark.
    
* **Readable code is lasting code** ‚Äî functions tell stories too.
    
* **Follow project conventions** ‚Äî every repo has its rhythm.
    
* **Small steps create big confidence.**
    

## The Real Impact

This one-line fix made Ghost‚Äôs **ActivityPub experience smoother** for every user.  
But more importantly, it made me realise something:

> Open source isn‚Äôt just about contributing code; it‚Äôs about contributing care.

That small act of improving a spinner made me part of a community that values every detail.

## Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre new to open source, start small.  
Find a bug you understand.  
Fix it. Document it. Share it.

You‚Äôll learn, grow, and feel the same joy I did seeing your name appear in the contributors list of a project you love.
