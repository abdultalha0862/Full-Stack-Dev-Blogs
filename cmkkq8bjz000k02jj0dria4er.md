## Introduction

This post shares my notes and reflections on **how to find remote jobs**, based on what I have learned by observing others, reading, and exploring different approaches.

I am writing this as someone who is still learning and experimenting, not as an expert.

If you are early in your career and trying to understand remote job opportunities, this might be helpful.

## Why I Looked Into Remote Jobs

I wanted to understand how people actually get remote jobs, beyond just applying on job portals.

I had heard about networking, building profiles, and open source before, but I wanted clearer direction on how these pieces fit together.

## What This Learning Focused On

The main focus was on two ways to find remote jobs:

* Applying to existing opportunities
    
* Creating opportunities by building credibility
    

It also highlighted common mistakes people make while searching for remote roles.

## Key Learnings

### Two Clear Ways to Find Remote Jobs

Remote jobs can be approached in two main ways.

The first is applying directly by checking:

* Company career pages
    
* Social media
    
* Platforms like LinkedIn and X
    

You can also reach out to company employees through LinkedIn messages, X, or cold emails and clearly express your interest.

**Why this matters:**  
Many roles are filled through direct outreach and early visibility, not just job boards.

### Creating Opportunities by Building Credibility

The second approach is long-term but powerful.

Instead of only applying, you build a strong online presence through:

* A clear LinkedIn profile
    
* Regular posts on X
    
* A portfolio or blog
    
* Sharing what you learn in public
    

**Why this matters:**  
When your work is visible, opportunities often come to you.

### Learning in Public and Networking

Learning in public means sharing progress, not perfection.

This includes:

* Posting what you are learning
    
* Sharing small wins and lessons
    
* Writing simple blogs on platforms like Hashnode
    

Networking here is about conversations, not asking for jobs.

**Why this matters:**  
People trust and remember consistent learners.

### Open Source as a Career Signal

Contributing to open source shows real skills.

It helps others see:

* How you work
    
* What you know
    
* How consistent you are
    

**Why this matters:**  
Open source becomes proof of work without needing explanations.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Lack of Clarity

Not knowing what role you want slows everything down.  
Explore different fields, then choose one direction.

### Chasing Numbers Instead of Credibility

Followers do not matter if your profile has no substance.  
Skills and consistency matter more.

### Giving Up Too Early

Remote jobs take time.  
Stopping too soon is a common mistake.

### Taking Rejection Personally

Rejections are part of the process.  
They help you improve if you stay patient.

### Lack of Patience

Remote hiring moves slowly.  
Consistency matters more than speed.

## Things That Made Me Think

1. Clarity matters more than applying everywhere
    
2. Visibility builds trust over time
    
3. Open work speaks louder than resumes
    
4. Patience is a real skill in remote job search
    

## My Reflections

This learning made me realize that remote jobs are not about shortcuts.

They are about clarity, steady effort, and showing your work openly.

## What I’m Taking Forward

1. Be clear about what I want
    
2. Build credibility step by step
    
3. Share learning without pressure
    
4. Stay patient and consistent
