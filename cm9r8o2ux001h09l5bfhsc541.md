## My key takeaways from this video are:

1. Developer advocacy is a role that bridges the gap between software developers and client requirements.
    
2. If you enjoy talking to people as well as engaging in development, you can make a valuable contribution in this role.
    
3. For any position, it's a good idea to try it out for some time before deciding if itâ€™s the right fit for you.
    
4. Maintaining a work-life balance is important, especially since this role may require you to travel to different countries for events. Set clear boundaries to ensure you take care of your physical health, which will help you perform at your best.
