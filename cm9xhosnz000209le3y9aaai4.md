# Intro to Python

* **What is Python?**
    
    Python is a popular programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** in 1989.
    
* **Why the Name "Python"?**
    
    It’s named after the British comedy show **Monty Python**, not the snake!
    
* **Why is Python Popular?**
    
    * Its syntax is simple and easy to learn, similar to the English language.
        
    * It’s beginner-friendly but also powerful enough for advanced tasks.
        
    * Python is versatile and widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
        

## How Python Works

Python is an **interpreted language**, which means it processes your code line by line instead of all at once. Let’s look at how it works behind the scenes:

### 1\. **Lexical Analysis**

* When you run a Python program, the first step is to break the code into small parts like keywords (`if`, `for`), variables (e.g., `x`, `name`), and symbols (`+`, `=`). These parts are called **tokens**.
    
* Python also allocates memory for the variables you’ve used, ensuring everything runs smoothly.
    

### 2\. **Syntax Analysis**

* Syntax is just a fancy way of saying “rules for writing code.” For example, Python uses **indentation** (spaces at the start of a line) to organize blocks of code.
    
* If you forget something like a colon (`:`) or use incorrect indentation, Python will throw a **syntax error**, and the program won’t run until you fix it.
    

### 3\. **Semantic Analysis**

* Once the syntax is correct, Python checks if the code makes sense. For example, if you try to add a number to a string (`5 + "hello"`), Python won’t understand it and will throw an error.
    

# Variables in Python

* **What is a Variable?**
    
    A variable is used to store a value in Python.
    
    * Example:
        
        ```python
        a = 10  # a is variable, 10 is value
        b = 20  # b is variable, 20 is value
        ```
        
* **How to Get the Type of a Variable?**
    
    We can check the data type of a variable using the `type()` function.
    
    * Example:
        
        ```python
        a = 10
        print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
        ```
        

## Data Types in Python

### 1\. **Numeric Types**

* **Integer (**`int`): Whole numbers like `10` or `5`.
    
* **Float (**`float`): Decimal numbers like `20.5` or `3.14`.
    
* **Complex (**`complex`): Numbers with a real and imaginary part, like `3 + 5j`.
    

Example:

```python
a = 10       # int
b = 20.5     # float
c = 3 + 5j   # complex

print(type(a))  # Output: <class 'int'>
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'float'>
print(type(c))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
```

### 2\. **Boolean (**`bool`)

* Represents `True` or `False`. Example:
    

```python
active = True
print(type(active))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

### 3\. **String (**`str`)

* A sequence of characters. Example:
    

```python
name = "Python"
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

## Other Built-In Data Types

* **List**: A collection of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.
    
* **Tuple**: An immutable collection, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`.
    
* **Set**: A collection of unique items, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.
    
* **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{"key": "value"}`.
    

## Dynamic Input in Python

You can take user input dynamically and check its type.

* Example:
    
    ```python
    a = input("Enter a value: ")
    print(type(a))  # By default, input() returns a string
    
    b = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    print(type(b))  # Converts input to an integer
    ```
    

# Operators in Python

### 1\. **Arithmetic Operators**

These operators perform basic mathematical operations:

* **Addition (**`+`): Adds two numbers.
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    a = 5
    b = 3
    print(a + b)  # Output: 8
    ```
    
* **Subtraction (\`\`)**: Subtracts one number from another.
    
    ```python
    print(a - b)  # Output: 2
    ```
    
* **Multiplication (\`\`)**: Multiplies two numbers.
    
    ```python
    print(a * b)  # Output: 15
    ```
    
* **Division (**`/`): Divides one number by another (returns a float).
    
    ```python
    print(a / b)  # Output: 1.6667
    ```
    
* **Floor Division (**`//`): Divides and truncates the result to the nearest integer.
    
    ```python
    print(a // b)  # Output: 1
    ```
    
* **Modulus (**`%`): Returns the remainder of the division.
    
    ```python
    print(a % b)  # Output: 2
    ```
    
* **Exponentiation (\`\`)**: Raises a number to the power of another.
    
    ```python
    print(a ** b)  # Output: 125
    ```
    

### 2\. **Assignment Operators**

These operators assign values to variables:

* `=`: Assigns a value.
    
* `+=`: Adds and assigns (`x += 1` is the same as `x = x + 1`).
    
* `=`: Subtracts and assigns.
    
* `=`: Multiplies and assigns.
    
* `/=`: Divides and assigns.
    

Example:

```python
x = 10
x += 5
print(x)  # Output: 15
```

### 3\. **Comparison Operators**

These compare two values:

* `==`: Equal to
    
* `!=`: Not equal to
    
* `<`: Less than
    
* `>`: Greater than
    
* `<=`: Less than or equal to
    
* `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    

Example:

```python
a = 10
b = 20
print(a == b)  # Output: False
print(a < b)   # Output: True
```

### 4\. **Logical Operators**

These are used to combine conditional statements:

* `and`: Returns `True` if both conditions are true.
    
* `or`: Returns `True` if at least one condition is true.
    
* `not`: Reverses the condition.
    

Example:

```python
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Output: False
print(x or y)   # Output: True
print(not x)    # Output: False
```

## Type Conversion in Python

Type conversion means converting one data type to another.

### Syntax:

```python
datatype(variable)
```

### Example:

```python
a = "10"
b = int(a)  # Converts string to integer
print(type(b))  # Output: <class 'int'>
```

## Exercises

1. **Convert String to Integer and Add with Float:**
    
    ```python
    a = "10"
    b = 20.5
    c = int(a) + b
    print(c)  # Output: 30.5
    ```
    
2. **Write a Program to Add Two Numbers:**
    
    ```python
    a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
    b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
    print("Sum:", a + b)
    ```
    
3. **Calculate the Perimeter and Area of a Rectangle:**
    
    ```python
    length = 7
    breadth = 5
    perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)
    area = length * breadth
    print("Perimeter:", perimeter)  # Output: 24
    print("Area:", area)  # Output: 35
    ```
    
4. **Calculate Simple Interest:**
    
    ```python
    principal = 5000
    rate = 5
    time = 3
    simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100
    print("Simple Interest:", simple_interest)  # Output: 750.0
    ```
    

# **Conditions**

In programming, conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

### **if Statement Syntax**

The `if` statement executes a block of code only if the specified condition evaluates to `True`.

```python
# If Statement
if condition:
    # <stmt-1>
    # ...
    # <stmt-n>
```

Example:

```python
num = 10
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if a == num:
    print("The number is equal to 10.")
if a == 20:
    print("The number is 20.")
```

### **if-else Statement Syntax**

The `if-else` statement allows you to execute one block of code if a condition is `True` and another block if the condition is `False`.

```python
if condition:
    # stmt-1 (executed if condition is True)
else:
    # stmt-2 (executed if condition is False)
```

Example:

```python
# Check greater number
a, b = 20, 10
if a > b:
    print("a is greater")
else:
    print("b is greater")
```

### **if-elif-else Statement Syntax**

The `if-elif-else` statement is used when there are multiple conditions to evaluate. It checks conditions sequentially, and the first `True` condition executes its block.

```python
if cond1:
    # stmt-1
elif cond2:
    # stmt-2
elif cond-n:
    # stmt-n
else:
    # stmt-default
```

Example:

```python
# Find the greatest of three numbers
a, b, c = 100, 80, 70
if a > b and a > c:
    print("a is the greatest")
elif b > a and b > c:
    print("b is the greatest")
else:
    print("c is the greatest")
```

Additional Example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age < 18:
    print("You are a minor.")
elif age >= 18 and age < 60:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior citizen.")
```

### **Checking if a Year is a Leap Year**

A year is a leap year if:

1. It is divisible by 4, and not divisible by 100, **or**
    
2. It is divisible by 400.
    

Example 1:

```python
year = 2024
if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0:
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not a leap year")
```

### **Calculate Simple Interest (SI) and Compound Interest (CI)**

**Simple Interest (SI):**

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

```plaintext
SI = (P × T × R) / 100
```

Where:

* `P` is the principal amount
    
* `T` is the time in years
    
* `R` is the rate of interest
    

Example:

```python
P = int(input("Enter principal amount: "))
T = int(input("Enter time in years: "))
R = int(input("Enter rate of interest: "))
SI = (P * T * R) / 100
print("Simple Interest:", SI)
```

**Compound Interest (CI):**

The formula for calculating compound interest is:

```plaintext
CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P
```

Where:

* `P` is the principal amount
    
* `T` is the time in years
    
* `R` is the rate of interest
    

Example:

```python
P = int(input("Enter principal amount: "))
T = int(input("Enter time in years: "))
R = int(input("Enter rate of interest: "))
Amt = P * pow((1 + R / 100), T)
CI = Amt - P
print("Compound Interest:", CI)
```

# **Iterations and Loops**

Loops allow the repetition of a block of code until a condition is no longer true. They are fundamental in programming for automating repetitive tasks.

### **Types of Loops in Python**

1. `for` Loop
    
    The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or range).
    
    **Syntax:**
    
    ```python
    for variable in sequence:
        # <stmt-1>
        # ...
        # <stmt-n>
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):  # Iterates from 1 to 10
        print(i)
    ```
    
2. `while` Loop
    
    The `while` loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the condition is `True`.
    
    **Syntax:**
    
    ```python
    while condition:
        # <stmt-1>
        # ...
        # <stmt-n>
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```python
    count = 1
    while count <= 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1
    ```
    

### **Using** `for` Loop with `range()`

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers and is often used with `for` loops.

**Syntax:**

```python
for variable in range(start, end, step):
    # <stmt-1>
    # ...
    # <stmt-n>
```

**Examples:**

1. **Basic Range Iteration:**
    
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 11):  # Iterates from 1 to 10
        print(i)
    ```
    
2. **Step Value in Range:**
    
    ```python
    for i in range(0, 20, 2):  # Iterates from 0 to 18 in steps of 2
        print(i)
    ```
    
3. **Reverse Range:**
    
    ```python
    for i in range(10, 0, -1):  # Iterates from 10 to 1
        print(i)
    ```
    

### **Using** `for` Loop with Data Structures

You can iterate over strings, lists, dictionaries, and other data structures using `for` loops.

**Examples:**

1. **Iterating Over a String:**
    
    ```python
    name = "xyzabc"
    for char in name:
        print(char, end=" ")
    # Output: x y z a b c
    ```
    
2. **Iterating Over a List:**
    
    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    for num in numbers:
        print(num)
    ```
    
3. **Iterating Over a Dictionary:**
    
    ```python
    data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
    for key, value in data.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")
    ```
    

### **Palindrome Checker**

A palindrome is a number or string that reads the same backward as forward.

**Checking Palindrome for Numbers:**

```python
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
temp = n  # Store the original number
rev = 0

# Reverse the number
while n > 0:
    rem = n % 10
    rev = (rev * 10) + rem
    n = n // 10

# Check if the number is a palindrome
if temp == rev:
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not a palindrome")
```

**Checking Palindrome for Strings:**

```python
string = input("Enter a string: ")
if string == string[::-1]:  # Check if the string equals its reverse
    print("Palindrome")
else:
    print("Not a palindrome")
```

### **Nested Loops**

A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop. The outer loop runs its iterations, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop executes completely.

### **Syntax of Nested Loops**

```python
for var1 in range(start1, end1):  # Outer loop
    # Outer loop statements
    for var2 in range(start2, end2):  # Inner loop
        # Inner loop statements
```

**Example:**

```python
for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop (iterates 3 times)
    print("Outer loop iteration:", i)
    for j in range(1, 3):  # Inner loop (iterates 2 times)
        print("  Inner loop iteration:", j)
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
Outer loop iteration: 1
  Inner loop iteration: 1
  Inner loop iteration: 2
Outer loop iteration: 2
  Inner loop iteration: 1
  Inner loop iteration: 2
Outer loop iteration: 3
  Inner loop iteration: 1
  Inner loop iteration: 2
```

### **Pattern Printing Using Nested Loops**

Nested loops are commonly used for printing patterns. Let's explore a few examples:

**Example 1: Print Right-Aligned Triangle**

```plaintext
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**Code:**

```python
n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Outer loop for rows
    for j in range(i):  # Inner loop for columns
        print("*", end="")
    print()  # Move to the next line after each row
```

**Example 2: Print Alphabets in a Triangle**

```plaintext
A
A B
A B C
A B C D
A B C D E
```

**Code:**

```python
n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Outer loop for rows
    for j in range(65, 65 + i):  # ASCII values for letters
        print(chr(j), end=" ")  # Convert ASCII to character
    print()  # Move to the next line after each row
```

**Example 3: Print Inverted Alphabet Triangle**

```plaintext
ABCDE
ABCD
ABC
AB
A
```

**Code:**

```python
n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(n, 0, -1):  # Outer loop for rows (decreasing)
    for j in range(65, 65 + i):  # ASCII values for letters
        print(chr(j), end=" ")  # Convert ASCII to character
    print()  # Move to the next line after each row
```

**Example 4: Center-Aligned Triangle**

```plaintext
    A
   A B
  A B C
 A B C D
A B C D E
```

**Code:**

```python
n = 5  # Number of rows
for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Outer loop for rows
    print(" " * (n - i), end="")  # Print spaces for alignment
    for j in range(65, 65 + i):  # Inner loop for alphabets
        print(chr(j), end=" ")
    print()  # Move to the next line
```

# **Functions**

A **function** is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions make code more reusable, and they return a value when called.

### **Syntax of Functions**

```python
def function_name(arguments):
    # Statements
    return value
```

### **Example of a Simple Function**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(10, 20))  # Output: 30
print(add(20, 30))  # Output: 50
```

### **Purpose of Functions**

The primary purpose of creating a function is **reusability**. You can call the function multiple times with different arguments, and it performs the task for you each time.

### **Example: Function that Squares a Number**

```python
def square(a):
    return a * a

print(square(4))  # Output: 16
```

### **Types of Functions**

1. **With Arguments and With Return Type**
    
2. **With Arguments and Without Return Type**
    
3. **Without Arguments and With Return Type**
    
4. **Without Arguments and Without Return Type**
    

### **Example 1: With Arguments and With Return Type**

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(10, 30))  # Output: 40
```

### **Example 2: Without Arguments and With Return Type**

```python
def name():
    return "Abdul"

print(name())  # Output: Abdul
```

### **Example 3: Function with Function**

You can also call one function inside another:

```python
def salary():
    return 4000

def name():
    return "Abdul"

x = name()
sal = salary()
print(f"{x} is getting a salary of {sal}")  # Output: Abdul is getting a salary of 4000
```

### **Lambda Functions**

A **lambda function** is an anonymous function. It is defined using the `lambda` keyword and can take any number of arguments but only have one expression.

### **Syntax of Lambda Function**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

### **Example: Lambda Function to Square a Number**

```python
square = lambda num: num * num
print(square(4))  # Output: 16
```

### **Example: Lambda Function to Cube a Number**

```python
cube = lambda num: num ** 3
print(cube(3))  # Output: 27
```

### **Map Function**

The `map()` function applies a given function to all items in a list (or any iterable).

### **Example: Using** `map()` to Cube Numbers in a List

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
cubes = list(map(lambda x: x ** 3, numbers))
print(cubes)  # Output: [1, 8, 27]
```

### **Example: Multiply Each Element by 8 Using** `map()`

```python
numbers = [7, 1, 8, 6]
result = list(map(lambda x: x * 8, numbers))
print(result)  # Output: [56, 8, 64, 48]
```

### **Filter Function**

The `filter()` function filters elements from a sequence based on a condition defined in a function. It returns the elements that satisfy the condition.

### **Syntax of** `filter()` Function

```python
filter(function, sequence)
```

### **Example: Filter Even Numbers**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### **Example: Filter Numbers Divisible by 7**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
divisible_by_7 = list(filter(lambda x: x % 7 == 0, numbers))
print(divisible_by_7)  # Output: [7]
```
