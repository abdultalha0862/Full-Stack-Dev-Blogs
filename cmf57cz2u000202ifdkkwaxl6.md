## The Initial Challenge

When I decided to set up Ghost for my blog, I thought it would be straightforward. I had some Docker experience, and Ghost seemed like a popular, well-documented platform. Little did I know I was about to embark on a debugging journey that would teach me valuable lessons about complexity vs simplicity.

## The Complex Setup That Failed

I started with what seemed like a comprehensive Ghost development environment, a monorepo setup with 15+ services. Here's what I initially tried to run:

The Docker Compose File has 317 lines. What I started with was a complex monorepo setup for services:

```bash
server:           Ghost Server (2GB RAM)
admin:            Ghost Admin (Port 4200)
combined:         Combined Ghost (Multiple ports)
mysql:            MySQL 8.4.5 (Port 3306)
redis:            Redis 7.0 (Port 6379)
caddy:            Reverse Proxy (Ports 80, 443)
mailhog:          Email Testing (Ports 1025, 8025)
analytics:        Analytics Service (Port 3000)
tinybird-local:   TinyBird Local (Port 7181)
Prometheus:       Prometheus (Port 9090)
Grafana:          Grafana (Port 3000)
pushgateway:      Push Gateway (Port 9091)
portal:           Portal (Ports 4175-4176)
comments-ui:      Comments UI (Ports 7173-7174)
announcement-bar: Announcement Bar (Port 4177)
search:           Search (Port 4178)
signup-form:      Signup Form (Port 6174)
... and more!
```

### Resource Requirements:

* Memory: 8-16GB RAM
    
* CPU: High-end development machine
    
* Storage: Several GB for all the services
    
* Network: 15+ port mappings
    

## Major Issues I Encountered

1. SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK Error: Invalid interpolation format for "volumes" service "server": invalid mount config for type "bind": Bind source path does not exist: /tmp/ssh-agent
    

What I Tried: Setting the SSH\_AUTH\_SOCK environment variable

2. Memory Issues - Admin Killed Error: Admin service killed due to memory constraints. Ghost admin container exiting with code 137
    

What I Tried:

* Increasing Docker memory limits
    
* Closing other applications
    

3. Theme Errors Theme error: Could not load theme. Failed to build admin assets
    
4. Port Conflicts Error: Port 3000 already in use. Cannot bind to port 4200
    
5. Build Failures ERROR: failed to solve: process "/bin/sh -c yarn install" did not complete successfully: exit code 1
    

## The Solution: Simplicity Wins

After hours of debugging, I made a crucial decision: Start simple, then scale up.

Instead of trying to run a full development environment, I switched to the official Ghost Docker image. Here's what changed everything:

### The Simple Setup That Works

My working solution - Clean and simple services:

```bash
version: '3.8'

services:
  ghost:
    image: ghost:latest  # Official Ghost image
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "2368:2368"
    environment:
      database__client: mysql
      database__connection__host: mysql
      database__connection__user: root
      database__connection__password: yourpassword
      database__connection__database: ghost
      url: http://localhost:2368
      NODE_ENV: development
    volumes:
      - ghost_content:/var/lib/ghost/content
    depends_on:
      mysql:
        condition: service_healthy
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M

  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "3307:3306"
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: ghost
    volumes:
      - mysql_data:/var/lib/mysql
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "mysqladmin", "ping", "-h", "localhost"]
      timeout: 20s
      retries: 10

  adminer:
    image: adminer:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"

volumes:
  ghost_content:
  mysql_data:
```

**Result**: From 317 lines to 62 lines, from 15+ services to 3 services, from 8-16GB RAM to 1.5GB RAM.

## Step-by-Step Working Setup

### Here's exactly how I got Ghost running:

**Step 1:** Clean Slate Remove all previous containers and images docker-compose down -v docker system prune -a

**Step 2:** Create the Simple Docker Compose. yml Create a new docker-compose.yml with the simple setup above, touch docker-compose.yml. Copy the working configuration

**Step 3:** Start the Services Start Ghost with the new setup: docker-compose up -d

Check if everything is running with docker-compose ps

Total Setup Time: 2 minutes Memory Usage: ~1.5GB Success Rate: 100%

## Lessons Learned

1. Start Simple, Scale Later Mistake: Trying to run a full development environment when I just needed Ghost. Lesson: Use official images first, then customise when you understand the system
    
2. Official Images Are Your Friend Mistake: Assuming custom builds are better. Lesson: Official Docker images are tested, stable, and maintained
    
3. Resource Management Matters Mistake: Ignoring memory and CPU requirements. Lesson: Always check your system resources before running complex setups
    
4. Debugging Skills Are Essential Mistake: Not systematically debugging each error. Lesson: Break down problems, test one component at a time
    

## Next Steps: Contributing to Open Source

Now that I have a stable Ghost setup, I've created a learning path to eventually contribute to Ghost as an open source project:

## Final Thoughts

This experience taught me that simplicity is not the enemy of power. My current Ghost setup gives me:

* All the features I need for blogging
    
* A stable, reliable environment
    
* Room to learn and grow
    
* A foundation for future development
    

Sometimes the best solution is not the most complex one. Start with what works, understand it completely, then add complexity when you actually need it.
