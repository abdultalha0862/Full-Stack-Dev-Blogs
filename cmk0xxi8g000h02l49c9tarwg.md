I recently watched a conversation between Kunal Kushwaha and Francisco about remote work, learning in public, and finding opportunities while growing in your career.

While watching the video, I wrote down a few points that stood out to me. This post is simply me organising those notes and sharing my reflections.

## Why I Watched This Video

I wanted to understand how people actually find remote jobs and how learning in public plays a role in that journey.

I’ve heard these ideas mentioned before, but this conversation helped me connect them more clearly with real experiences.

## Key Learnings from the Video

### Remote Work Removes Daily Travel Stress

One of the first things discussed was how remote work eliminates travel time.

If your office is far away, commuting can take up a big part of your day and add unnecessary stress.  
With remote work, you start your day fresh, without that mental and physical exhaustion.

That alone changes how you show up at work.

### Remote Work Encourages Better Communication

In remote jobs, most communication happens through video calls.

Because of this, you naturally start getting more comfortable being on camera.  
Over time, this helps reduce hesitation and awkwardness when speaking online.

This comfort doesn’t stay limited to work it slowly extends to other areas like social media and public communication.

### Company Offsites Help Build Real Connections

Even in remote companies, offsites play an important role.

Meeting teammates in person, even occasionally, helps you understand people better beyond screens.  
It strengthens relationships and makes collaboration feel more human.

### Learning in Public Builds Credibility

A major point from the conversation was about *learning in public*.

Sharing what you’re learning helps build:

* Credibility
    
* Proof of work
    
* Visibility over time
    

This doesn’t mean pretending to be an expert.  
It simply means documenting your learning honestly.

Over time, this can naturally lead to opportunities including job offers.

### Ways to Learn in Public

Some ways mentioned in the video:

* Writing posts on Twitter or LinkedIn
    
* Writing blogs on platforms like Hashnode or Medium
    
* Sharing small learnings, not polished tutorials
    

The idea is consistency, not perfection.

### For Introverts: Start Small

The conversation also touched on introverts and how they can get started.

You don’t need to force yourself into big meetups or conferences immediately.  
It’s okay to take things step by step.

Start small:

* Write a short post
    
* Share a simple thought
    
* Slowly build confidence
    

There’s no need to put too much pressure on yourself.

## Things That Made Me Think

* Comfort with the camera is becoming an important skill
    
* Communication matters as much as technical ability
    
* Growth doesn’t need to be loud or fast
    

The video made it clear that improvement happens gradually.

## My Reflections

One strong takeaway for me was the importance of being comfortable on camera.

If you are comfortable speaking on camera:

* You can join remote meetings confidently
    
* You can create video content if you want
    
* You open yourself up to more future opportunities
    

It’s not about becoming a content creator overnight.  
It’s about reducing fear and being open to showing up.

This video made me realise that many future opportunities come from being visible and comfortable expressing yourself.

## What I’m Taking Forward

I don’t feel the need to rush anything.

For now, I want to focus on:

* Improving one step at a time
    
* Being more comfortable communicating
    
* Sharing my learning honestly, without pressure
    

This post itself is part of that process.
